# MP<sup>2</sup>

## Introduction
This is the code repository related to our paper [Model Parameter Prediction Method for Distributed Machine Learning]. The paper is currently under review, and the code will be made public after acceptance.

## Current Status
- **Paper Status:** Under review
- **Code Status:** In preparation

## Description
As the size of machine learning models and datasets increases, distributed training becomes popular to reduce the training time. However, a severe communication bottleneck limits its scalability. Many methods aim to solve this communication bottleneck by reducing communication traffic, such as gradient sparsification and quantification. However, these methods either are at the expense of losing model accuracy or introduce lots of computing overhead. Thus, we propose a model parameter prediction method (MP2) under parameter server (PS) framework.

## Instructions
We will provide basic project structure and usage instructions to give readers an idea of how to use the code. Detailed instructions and examples will be updated after the code is released.

## Plan
- [ ] Wait for paper acceptance
- [ ] Make the code public
- [ ] Provide detailed documentation
